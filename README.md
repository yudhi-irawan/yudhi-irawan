About me

Hi, I'm Yudhi from Indonesia, i'm developing tools to make it easier to make software, especially software for web development using PHP.

Maybe someone wants to try my program.

This program is a kind of tool, which is to speed up the creation of CRUD script files which repeats itself in the same pattern. Such as View, Add, Edit, Delete, etc. The results of the CRUD script can be directly used or modified accordingly with need.

This program is called MCG, which stands for Massive Crud Generator. Program is my original. Although there may be similarities with similar programs.

Programs are in the form of EXE files and some are free and some are registered. Whether it's free or registered, the content is the same. What is registered is a form of your support and as our encouragement. You can provide support/support/saweran/trakteer as our encouragement to produce new releases, with no strings attached / certain conditions.

The target of this program is specifically for colleagues who are still learning script programming such as PHP, although it is possible to colleagues who are already proficient, or also for colleagues who want to try

I am sharing my knowledge to help make office life a little less annoying ;)
